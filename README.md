<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, I designed a security door system that could be installed in an office. It had a number of different sensors which could display to the user whether the door would grant access or not. It included a motion detector that used recursion to reset the timer to prevent the door closing if an object/person was in the way. If you would like to interact with the project please view the simulation via the Wokwi link above.

- [x] Created circuit with button to turn on LED.
- [x] Created circuit with button and servo, servo moves based on button press.
- [x] Added buzzer, for doorbell.
- [x] Added LEDs for door open and close.
- [x] Added LCD and potentiometer to the circuit to display messages and dim brightness of LCD.
- [x] Created interface using the keypad.
- [x] Added different functions to keypad buttons.
- [x] Buzzer now plays tones based on keypad presses.
- [x] Added door timer to circuit with buzzer tone to alert that door is closing
- [x] Motion sensor added to detect motion preventing door from closing and resetting timer, this was achieved with recursion.
- [x] New tune added to doorbell button.
